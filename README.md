# Country Information DB
## A JAVA based Implementation of a RESTful API using SpringBoot Reactor Core and R2DBC


## How it works?
In this project, all dependency are added based on `maven`. To the date of adding to this `commit` all of them are
the latest version. Let's get started!

There are a couple of easy ways to run this project like all other JAVA applications. However, 
here, two simple commands are announced.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vahidmohsseni/CountryService
cd CountryService
```


### 1 With `MAVEN`

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot::run
```

### 2 With 'MAVEN'
```shell
./mvnw package
java -jar target/MyApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

### 3 With Docker
```shell
./mvnw package
docker-compose up
```




## Requirements
Remember to install JAVA JDK version 8 or upper.
If you want to run it using Docker, the latest version of docker is fine.
